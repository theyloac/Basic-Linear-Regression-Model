## Summary
### Data Loading and Visualization
- We loaded the dataset, visualized the relationship between "Investment" and "Return," and confirmed a generally linear trend.

### Model Building
- We used a simple Linear Regression model from scikit-learn.

### Evaluation
- We calculated error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and the R² score to measure performance.

### Prediction
- We set up a step to predict returns for new, user-provided investment amounts.

## Potential Improvements
### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Although standard linear regression doesn’t have many hyperparameters, we could explore polynomial features or regularized regression (Ridge/Lasso) for better performance if the data suggests nonlinearity or overfitting.

### Feature Engineering
- If additional features (e.g., inflation rates, economic indicators) are available, incorporating them might improve predictive accuracy.

### Model Deployment
- We could containerize this application (using Docker, for example) and provide a REST API for real-time predictions in a production environment.

By refining these aspects, you can build a more robust and scalable solution for predicting the financial return of government bond investments or other similar financial instruments.
